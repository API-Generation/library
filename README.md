This is the example Library project for use with Api Generation's Model Transform Tool (MTT). It is intended to be copied (forked) into a user's repository so that MTT can be run from there.
The MTT generated outputs will be written to the user's repository and committed.
For detailed instructions on how to register and install MTT please go to [Try out MTT](https://apigeneration.tech/try-mtt). We hope you find it interesting.
