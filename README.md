This is the Library example project for use with Api Generation's Model Transform Tool (MTT). It is intended to be copied (forked) into a user's repository so that MTT can be run.
The MTT generated outputs will be written to the user's repository and committed.
For detailed instructions on how to register and install MTT please go to [Try out MTT](https://apigeneration.tech/try-mtt). We hope you find it interesting.
